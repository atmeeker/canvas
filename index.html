<h2>Services Disclaimer, Terms and Conditions</h2>
<p>The Office of Career and Professional Development at Washington and Lee University provides career and professional development services, such as the listings of jobs and internships, at no charge to students and alumni seeking employment. While CPD provides internship/job referral services, CPD does not conduct background checks or vet employers or internships/job postings, makes no recommendations as to any of the listings or potential employers, and is not responsible for safety, wages, working conditions, or any other aspect of off-campus employment. Students and alumni must perform due diligence when applying for or accepting off-campus employment, and do so at their own risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CPD will not post internship or job listings that appear to discriminate against applicants on the basis of race, color, religion, creed, age, national origin, disabled or veteran status, sexual orientation, disability, gender, or any class protected by law, and reserves the right to edit or refuse postings for any reason.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a condition to using the University's CPD website and referral service, students and alumni agree that:<strong> (1) use of the website is at the user's own risk; (2) the University shall not be liable with regards to usage of the site; (3) the University is not responsible for the content made available through the web links to other websites; and (4) the opinions and views associated with the websites are not those of the University.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<h2>Handshake Disclaimer</h2>
<p>The Office of Career and Professional Development (“CPD”) at Washington and Lee University provides an online platform for students and alumni, whereby employers may post information about their company, current job listings and recruiting events. This system, known as “Handshake,” allows students and alumni to access job listings, submit applications for certain job listings, and arrange interviews with particular employers.</p>
<p>CPD makes reasonable efforts to check the legitimacy of employers before granting access to post on the W&amp;L Handshake platform; however, due to the vast volume of postings on Handshake, CPD cannot guarantee the legitimacy and integrity of all employers and postings. CPD is not responsible for the safety, salary, availability, working conditions, or other aspects of employment related to internships, co-ops, or full-time positions posted on Handshake. CPD makes no representations, recommendations, or guarantees regarding the accuracy or reliability, or otherwise, of any employer, posted job listing or recruiting event, or employment data transmitted through Handshake.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Employment listings found on the Handshake site do not constitute an endorsement of any particular employer or their policies by Washington and Lee University's Office of Career and Professional Development (CPD). It is the responsibility of each applicant to research and verify the integrity of the employing organization and to make appropriate inquiries about the position in which they are interested. As such, we encourage students and alumni to use caution, safeguard their search, and use discretion during the search process. If you are unsure about a position or employer, contact your Career Advisor directly or the CPD staff at careers@wlu.edu for a second opinion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CPD urges all applicants to exercise caution and common sense when utilizing Handshake and when applying for any position. If you feel uncomfortable about a job opportunity that you find, do not provide any personal information. Be wary if a job or employer:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Offers you a job with little or no interaction with you.</li>
  <li>Offers a large amount of money for a little work or payment before work has been completed.</li>
  <li>Requests personal information such as your social security number, bank account or credit card information, copies of passport, license or other personal documents.</li>
  <li>Requests you to make any type of wire transfer from one account to another.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Uses a personal email address instead of a company email address.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Posts a listing that includes multiple spelling and grammatical errors.&nbsp;</li>

</ul><p>Should you find any of these issues within Handshake, please contact CPD at (540) 458-8595 or careers@wlu.edu.</p>
